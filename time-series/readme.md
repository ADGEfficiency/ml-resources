## [Advances in weather prediction](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/342)

> Because data are unavoidably spatially incomplete and uncertain, the state of the atmosphere at any time cannot be known exactly, producing forecast uncertainties that grow into the future. This sensitivity to initial conditions can never be overcome completely. But, by running a model over time and continually adjusting it to maintain consistency with incoming data, the resulting physically consistent predictions greatly improve on simpler techniques. Such data assimilation, often done using four-dimensional variational minimization, ensemble Kalman filters, or hybridized techniques, has revolutionized forecasting.

> Sensitivity to initial conditions limits long-term forecast skill: Details of weather cannot be predicted accurately, even in principle, much beyond 2 weeks. But weather forecasts are not yet strongly constrained by this limit, and the increase in forecast skill has shown no sign of ending (4, 5). Sensitivity to initial conditions varies greatly in space and time, and an important but largely unsung advance in weather prediction is the growing ability to quantify the forecast uncertainty by using large ensembles of numerical forecasts that each start from slightly different but equally plausible initial states, together with perturbations in model physics.

[Probabilistic forecasting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_forecasting)

Probabilistic forecasting summarizes what is known about, or opinions about, future events. In contrast to single-valued forecasts (such as forecasting that the maximum temperature at a given site on a given day will be 23 degrees Celsius, or that the result in a given football match will be a no-score draw), probabilistic forecasts assign a probability to each of a number of different outcomes, and the complete set of probabilities represents a probability forecast.

## Prophet

[Prophet: Automatic Forecasting Procedure | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37663820)

Model development on Prophet stopped this year.

Prophet is not a particularly good model for forecasting, and has been superseded by a multitude of other models


[Is Facebook's “Prophet” the time-series Messiah or just a naughty boy? | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27695574)

"Point-forecasts" are mostly useless in many import practical applications such as FinTech, e-commerce, sports betting, etc. Point-forecast models such as Prophet fail to give you a meaningful measure of uncertainty of the predicted value.

Probability distribution is the right language to express prediction values and their uncertainty at the same time. And the decisions based on forecasts oftentimes take the uncertainty measures in consideration, e.g. portfolio risk optimization or buying decisions in e-commerce.

# [Zillow, Prophet, Time Series, & Prices – r y x, r](https://ryxcommar.com/2021/11/06/zillow-prophet-time-series-and-prices/)

Here is my latest, nuanced opinion on Prophet after looking into it more for this post: it’s a nifty tool if you know what you’re doing or are doing something unimportant, and it is possibly very dangerous if you don’t know what you’re doing and are using it to make an actual decision.

`f(t)` means function of time. But time series processes aren’t only functions of time. Or only of contemporaneous covariates. They’re also functions of lagged values, including lagged values of the variable you’re regressing on. So to say that a time series is `f(t)` is to specifically say that it’s not a function of other things, namely previous data points, such as the previous dependent variable value.

This is an accurate description of what Prophet’s model is. To get a little more in the weeds, Prophet does the following linear decomposition:

- `g(t)`: Logistic or linear growth trend with optional linear splines (linear in the exponent for the logistic growth). The library calls the knots “change points.”
- `s(t)`: Sine and cosine (i.e. Fourier series) for seasonal terms.
- `h(t)`: Gaussian functions (bell curves) for holiday effects (instead of dummies, to make the effect smoother).

So the main caveat of Prophet is that it’s does “curve fitting.” This is fine for problems like web traffic forecasts, and some other crude forms of anomaly detection where the actionable decision is something minor like “send a notification to my Slack channel.” But why’s Prophet so bad for Zillow, exactly?

So to summarize, the problem with Prophet here is that it doesn’t model prices as a function of previous values, which is a very wrong way to think about how prices work. It’s that simple.

You can predict your way out of that problem and try to reduce the residuals, which is the natural data science thing to do, but that’s not a smart way to do risk management. 

Unfortunately for Zillow’s shareholders, risk management is often going to be a blind spot when you hire a bunch of data scientists without finance sector experience.
