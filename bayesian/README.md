The brain routinely interprets sensory information in a probabilistic way, even if humans struggle with verbal probability estimates.

The brain uses a Bayesian approach, representing percepts and memories as probability distributions rather than point estimates. 

The mean activity represents the best guess, while the width/deviation represents the uncertainty.

Encoding uncertainty jointly with the memory itself may allow the brain to appropriately weight and use its imperfect memories when making decisions.
