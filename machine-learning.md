[Black-box vs. white-box models - Lars Hulstaert](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-interpretability-techniques-662c723454f3)

The accuracy vs. interpretability trade-off is based on a important assumption, namely that ‘explainability is an inherent property of the model’.
I strongly believe however that with the right ‘interpretability techniques’, any machine learning model can be made more interpretable, albeit at a complexity and cost which is higher for some models than others.
