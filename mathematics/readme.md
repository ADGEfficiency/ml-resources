[So You Want to Study Mathematics...](https://www.susanrigetti.com/math) - if you can understand the structure of literature, if you can understand the basic grammar of the English language or any other language, then you can understand the basics of the language of the universe.

# Intro

My experience with learning math is that the first months are all about backtracking. You have to fill all your holes.

It's basically one big graph of concepts.

The tricky part is, most beginners simply don't know how to navigate that graph.

They see complex numbers with their exponentials and cos/sin forms and shut down.

They can learn all these concepts no problem, but finding what they need to learn defeats them.

Vector norm = magnitude = length
- often used in regularization
- L1 = sum of abs values 
- L2 = square root of sum of squares
