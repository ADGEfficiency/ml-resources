[Against Predictive Optimization](https://predictive-optimization.cs.princeton.edu/)

Predictive optimization to refer to automated decision-making systems where machine learning is used to make predictions about some future outcome pertaining to individuals, and those predictions are used to make decisions about them. 

## Seven flaws of predictive optimization

### Good predictions may not lead to good decisions

### It's hard to measure what we truly care about 

### The training data rarely matches the deployment setting 

### Social outcomes aren’t accurately predictable, with or without machine learning 

### Disparate performance between groups can’t be fixed by algorithmic interventions 

However, a system that is fair in a statistical sense may nonetheless perpetuate, reify, or even amplify long-standing cycles of inequality. 

### Providing adequate contestability undercuts putative efficiency benefits 

In many cases, the decisions were based on incorrect data, but the decision subjects had no recourse.

### Predictive optimization doesn't account for strategic behavior 

Predictive optimization can create unintended incentives for decision subjects to game the system.
